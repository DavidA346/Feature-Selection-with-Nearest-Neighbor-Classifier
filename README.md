# üîç Optimizing Feature Selection with Nearest Neighbor Classifier

This project explores how **feature selection algorithms** influence classification accuracy using a custom implementation of the **Nearest Neighbor classifier**. 
It applies **Forward Selection** and **Backward Elimination** on two datasets of different scales to identify the most relevant features and reduce model complexity.

---

## Features

-  Implements two core feature selection algorithms:
  - Forward Selection
  - Backward Elimination

- Uses a custom-built Nearest Neighbor classifier (k = 1)
- Compares accuracy across:
  - Small dataset: 500 instances, 6 features
  - Large dataset: 1000 instances, 40 features
- Outputs best-performing feature subsets and classification accuracy
